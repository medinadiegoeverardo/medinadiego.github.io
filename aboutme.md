I'm Diego Medina and a DS8 student at Lambda School. I don't have a strong focus just yet as I'm still trying to find what grabs and mesmerizes me. Just by scanning my room however, my interests may range from philosophy, nutrition, type design. Finance, business and nutrition have been showing good prospects as of late. Going into any of these fields as a data scientist might be very interesting.
