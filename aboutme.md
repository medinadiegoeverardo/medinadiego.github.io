Hi, I'm Diego Medina and a DS8 student at Lambda School. Just by scanning my room, my interests may range from: 

- Philosophy
- Nutrition
- Business
- Type Design

I don't have a strong focus just yet; Still trying to find what grabs and mesmerizes me. It's part of the process so I'm not worried. Finance, business and nutrition have been showing good prospects as of late.
